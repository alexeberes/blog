I'm Alex, a first-year undergraduate studying Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. I'm also an undergraduate researcher at Northwestern; I work in the Leonard Lab for Cellular Devices and Biomolecular Engineering. My work focuses on mammalian synthetic biology, specifically, synthetic transcription factors and receptors. I'm especially interested in engineering cells to treat various diseases.<!--more-->

I'm originally from Houston, Texas, but moved around a lot growing up. After living in Texas, Michigan, France, and Bahrain; calling Greece, my grandparents' birthplace, my second home; and traveling to over a dozen countries on four of the seven continents, I've considered myself more a citizen of the world than of any one country.

Growing up, I've loved science and been interested in trying to figure out how things work. As a kid, I loved building Lego sets, reverse engineering things, and reading. I fell in love with programming as soon as I taught myself Python, HTML, CSS, Java, and C. Soon, I was designing websites and, as my high school robotics team's programmer, made it to the Vex Robotics Competition World Championship two years in a row.

My favorite parts of programming and robotics were seeing how each individual part or line of code works with each other piece to build a whole that's capable of accomplishing complex tasks that the individual parts never could on their own and using those parts to design devices able to solve problems.

When I discovered molecular and cellular biology, I found the same excitement that I felt when I learned to code. Following the laws of chemistry, each protein, nucleic acid, etc. reacts with others to create cells, tissues, organs, that are so much more than the sums of their parts. Consider the immune system, where the combination of individually lifeless and mindless pieces come together forming unique cells that together have a sort of intelligence able to defend your body! Being able to engineer and design that our biological cellular systems to fight diseases -- from the cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases that inflicted my grandfather to the infectious diseases behind the 2014 Ebola Epidemic and 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic -- fascinates me!

Now that you know a little about me, welcome to my blog! Here I'll be posting about my research, books I've read, or anything else that interests me. I hope you enjoy!
